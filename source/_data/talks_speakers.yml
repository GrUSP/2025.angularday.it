  speaker_role: "Software Architect @ Ingenium"
  speaker_bio: "My passion for computing began in 1985, when I first encountered a Commodore 64. It was love at first sight, and I immediately knew what my professional path would be. Today, with the same enthusiasm I had as a kid, I develop software and design architectures that enhance people's productivity. I strongly believe in the value of collaboration and knowledge sharing principles I strive to pass on to those who attend my courses or work alongside me. Since 2006, I have contributed as a speaker at national conferences such as WPC, Codemotion, XE One Day, Google Dev Fest, and others. During these events, I present sessions on advanced development techniques and share insights from real-world cases encountered in my daily work."

  speaker_role: "Software Engineer @ Theodo Fintech"
  speaker_bio: "I'm a web developer at TheodoFintech for the past 2 years, specializing in Angular and tackling complex frontend bugs. Passionate about debugging, I've developed a deep understanding of Angular's internals, which I share through training sessions and technical articles. This knowledge-sharing has helped reduce recurring bugs by 50% across three teams, especially on large-scale projects with Bpifrance. Lately, I've been exploring frontend architecture and design patterns to make Angular apps more robust and scalable — and I love sharing those insights on stage. I'm also passionate about public speaking and regularly take part in eloquence competitions."
